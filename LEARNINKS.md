# Angular masterclass

## Compilation times
platformBrowserDynamic uses "just-in-time compilation"

to improve speed, use pre-compilation and use a different platform-Browser

## props vs. attributes
Attributes are always strings, whereas properties can be objects.

That's why [title] semantically defines you want to access the **property** instead of the **attribute** of an element.

## Angular 2 user decides how values are bound
In contrast to AngularJS (angular 1).
